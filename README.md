# rps_game

This was a small project I made while going through the Odin Project Foundations Course.

It's a simple rock-paper-scissor game I made using javascript. 

You get asked for a prompt to choose either rock, paper or scissors. 

It's a best of 5 that prints the winner at the end of the game. 

Enjoy!
